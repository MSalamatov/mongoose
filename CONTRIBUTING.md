# 2. Versions

## 2.1. Backward Compatibility

The following interfaces are mentioned as the subject of the backward compatibility:
1. Input (item list files, scenario files, configuration options)
2. Output files containing the metrics
3. API

## 2.2. Numbers

Mongoose uses the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). This means that the ***X.Y.Z*** version notation is used:

* ***X***<br/>
    Major version number. Points to significant design and interfaces change. The *backward compatibility* is **not
    guaranteed**.
* ***Y***<br/>
    Minor version number. The *backward compatibility* is guaranteed.
* ***Z***<br/>
    Patch version number. Includes only the defect fixes.

# 3. Issues

Types:
* Defect
* Story
* Task
* Sub-task

| Type     | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Defect   | The defect/bug which **affects the released version** (the type "Task" should be used if a defect/bug affects the version which is not released yet) |
| Story    | High-level use case or a long-term activity aspect (testing, performance, etc) |
| Task     | A task which couldn't be included into any defect/story |
| Sub-task | A task which could be included into a defect/story |

Tracker link: https://mongoose-issues.atlassian.net/projects/BASE

## 3.1. States

| State       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| OPEN        | All new issues should have this state. The issues are selected from the set of the *OPEN* issues for the proposal and review process. The task is updated w/ the corresponding comment but left in the *OPEN* state if it's considered incomplete/incorrect. Also incomplete/incorrect issue should be assigned back to the reporter.
| PROPOSED    | The issue is selected for the approval by the *owners*.
| DEFERRED    | Owners have approved the issue to be processed after the next major/minor (non-patch) version is released.
| ACCEPTED    | Owners approved the issue to be processed before the next major/minor (non-patch) version is released.
| ESCALATED   | Critical defect which interrupts all *DEFERRED*/*ACCEPTED* issues processing. Causes the new *patch* version release ASAP.
| IN PROGRESS | The issue is in progress currently either initially done and the corresponding merge request to the `master` branch is created
| RESOLVED    | Issue is done and the corresponding changes are merged into the `master` branch
| CLOSED      | The new version is released containing the corresponding changes

**Note**:
> The corresponding impact probability/frequency is not taken into account in the process currently. For example, all
> defects are assumed to be equally frequently occurring and affecting same users, regardless the particular
> scenario/use case. This approach is used due to the lack of the sufficient statistical information about the Mongoose
> usage.

## 3.2. Defects Priority

| Priority     | Conditions | Target state as a result of the review
|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------
| Critical     | No workaround available **and** any of the following: <ul><li>Crash</li><li>Hang</li><li>Not functioning</li><li>Functioning incorrectly</li><li>Performance degradation</li></ul> | `ESCALATED`
| Non-critical | Not *critical* **and** not *minor* | `ACCEPTED` (for the next minor/major version)
| Minor        | Any of the following: <ul><li>Usability issue</li><li>Cosmetic</li></ul> | `OPEN` or `ACCEPTED`

# 4. Continuous Integration

https://gitlab.com/emcmongoose/mongoose/pipelines
for Windows: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/veronikaKochugova/mongoose

## 4.1. Build

Mongoose may be distributed as a single jar. JDK 11+ is required to build.

```bash
./gradlew clean jar
```

The resulting jar file path is `./build/libs/mongoose-<VERSION>.jar`.

## 4.2. Testing

### 4.2.1. Unit Tests

```bash
./gradlew clean test
```

### 4.2.2. Integration Tests

```bash
./gradlew clean integrationTest
```

### 4.2.3. Legacy System Tests

The system tests use the [JUnit parameterization](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Parameterized-tests). The parameter values are taken from the environment. The list of the system tests parameters below:

| Parameter Name | Acceptable Values                      | Values Meaning
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------
| STORAGE_TYPE   | s3, atmos, fs, swift                   | (the same)
| RUN_MODE       | local, distributed                     | 1, 2
| CONCURRENCY    | unlimited, single, small, medium, high | 0, 1, 10, 100, 1000
| ITEM_SIZE      | empty, small, medium, large, huge      | 0, 10KB, 1MB, 100MB, 10GB

To run the system tests for the particular case use the commands like
below:

```bash
export MONGOOSE_IMAGE_VERSION=testing
export STORAGE_TYPE=s3
export RUN_MODE=distributed
export CONCURRENCY=medium
export ITEM_SIZE=small
./gradlew clean systemTest --tests com.emc.mongoose.system.CircularAppendTest
```

Note that some system tests will not run for some parameter values. The acceptable parameter values are declared explicitly in the `.travis.yml` file.

#### 4.2.3.1. Containerized Tests

Since v4.0.0 all system tests are containerized. To run a system test locally it's necessary to
prepare testing Docker image manually:

```bash
./gradlew buildImage
```

Also it's necessary to supply the testing image version to the system
test via environment variable `MONGOOSE_IMAGE_VERSION`:

```bash
export MONGOOSE_IMAGE_VERSION=testing
export STORAGE_TYPE=atmos
export RUN_MODE=distributed
export CONCURRENCY=medium
export ITEM_SIZE=small
./gradlew clean systemTest --tests com.emc.mongoose.system.CreateNoLimitTest
```

### 4.2.4. Endurance Tests

```bash
export MONGOOSE_IMAGE_VERSION=testing
export STORAGE_TYPE=swift
export RUN_MODE=distributed
export CONCURRENCY=unlimited
export ITEM_SIZE=large
./gradlew clean enduranceTest --tests com.emc.mongoose.endurance.ParallelPipelineAndInfiniteLoopTest
```

### 4.2.5. Robot Tests

*Note*:
> Currently the Robot tests are failing when being executed locally and passing when being executed on the [Gitlab CI](https://gitlab.com/emcmongoose/mongoose/pipelines)

```bash
export SUITE=<SUITE>
export TEST=<TEST>
./gradlew robotest
```

Example:
```bash
SUITE=api.storage TEST=s3 ./gradlew clean robotest
```

## 4.3. Releasing

1. Ensure all tests are OK
2. Ensure the new version documentation is ready
3. Share the testing build with QE and repeat this step until the qualification is OK
4. Create/replace the corresponding VCS tags:
   ```bash
   git tag -d latest
   git push origin :refs/tags/latest
   git tag -a <X>.<Y>.<Z> -m <X>.<Y>.<Z>
   git tag -a latest -m <X>.<Y>.<Z>
   git push --tags --force
   ```
5. Create the corresponding version branch `release-v<X>.<Y>.<Z>` and set the version in the configuration to
   <X>.<Y>.<Z>
6. Deploy docker images, set the `<X>.<Y>.<Z>` and `latest` tags also for the Docker images.
7. Upload the artifacts to the Central Maven repo:
   1.
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean uploadArchives
    ```
   2. Go to the https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories find the corresponding repository, close and then release
      it.
8. Update the projects depending on the Mongoose's API (storage drivers, at least)

# 5. Code

## 5.1. Style

[Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) is used as default.

### Autoformatting hook

Git autoformatting hook reformats Java source code to comply with [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). 

The hook script is in the root of the repository named `pre-commit`.`pre-commit` **MUST be copied to the directory** `.git/hooks/` and you need to check that the script has the access permissions to execute:
```bash
ls -l pre-commit
```
If not, assign permissions for execution:
```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
```
This hook will work automatically with any commit and format the code in the same style.

### In addition:

* If interface is named `Foo` then:
  * Abstract implementation should be named as `FooBase`
  * Default concrete implementation should be names as `FooImpl`
* Any field/local variable should be *final* if possible

## 5.2. Exception Handling

The threads are not used in the usual way (*fibers* are used instead for the multitasking purposes). Therefore, having
an `InterruptedException` thrown means that the run was interrupted externally. To stop the run, it's necessary to pass
the specific exception to the uppermost level of the call stack. However, the `InterruptedException` is a checked
exception and usually couldn't be passed outward. The specific unchecked `InterruptRunException` is used for this
purpose. This imposes the restrictions on the exceptions handling:

* If the `InterruptedException` is caught the `InterruptRunException` should be thrown:
    ```java
    try {
        foo(); // may throw an InterruptedException
    } catch(final InterruptedException e) {
        throw new InterruptRunException(e);
    }
    ```

* The following exceptions catching should be avoided as far as the `InterruptRunException` may be swallowed
occasionally:
    1. `Throwable`
    2. `Exception`
    3. `RuntimeException`

## 5.3. Performance
Take care about the performance in the ***critical*** places:
* Avoid *frequent* objects instantiation
* Avoid unnecessary *frequent* allocation
* Avoid *frequent* method calls if possible
* Avoid deep call stack if possible
* Avoid I/O threads blocking
* Avoid anonymous classes in the time-critical code
* Avoid non-static inner classes in the time-critical code
* Use thread locals (encryption, string builders)
* Use buffering, buffer everything
* Use batch processing if possible
